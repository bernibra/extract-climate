# Climatic variables for a field site in Switzerland
The columns represent commonly used [(19) bioclimatic variables](https://worldclim.org/data/bioclim.html) derived from the monthly temperature and rainfall values. For a description on how to calculte these, follow the section 'Bioclimatic parameters' from the [CHELSA Technical Specification manual](http://chelsa-climate.org/wp-admin/download-page/CHELSA_tech_specification.pdf). The rows, on the other hand, characterize the different datasets from which the data was extracted.

## WorldClim data
The data in row with id 'worldclim' was downloaded from [https://www.worldclim.org/](https://www.worldclim.org/). The data was downloaded choosing a spatial resolution of 30 seconds. Check the specifications on how the data was generated in [https://www.worldclim.org/](https://www.worldclim.org/).

*Monthly, historical records and future projections could also be downloaded and provided for some of the variables. Contact Bernat Bramon Mora if support is needed.*

**If you use this data, you need to acknowledge the WorldClim contribution and cite accordingly.**

## CHELSA data
